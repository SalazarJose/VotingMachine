# VotingMachine
#####A program used to record votes.

The current program is written in C++, but might later be implemented in other languages
such as Java or Python.

The program is linked together with files that contain certain organized functions and methods. Compile main.cpp and execute it on your system.

Current Function will only have very basic "asking" and "pulling" of data. Future implementations might include using a linked list data structure.

As for "voting" separate classes will be created for the "Teams" to cast a vote with.

##UPDATES

At the time being I have added a "DEMO" that runs along with the linkedlist (which currently only supports one node.)

The DEMO uses fixed data, except for the date (expiration variable).

linkedlist.cpp is not included in the running program, but might be used to organize contents from linkedlist.hpp header file.
